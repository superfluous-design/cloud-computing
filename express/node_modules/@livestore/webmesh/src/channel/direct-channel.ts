/**
 * Behaviour:
 * - Waits until there is an initial edge
 * - Automatically reconnects on disconnect
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - We've split up the functionality into a wrapper channel and an internal channel.
 * - The wrapper channel is responsible for:
 *   - Forwarding send/listen messages to the internal channel (via a queue)
 *   - Establishing the initial channel and reconnecting on disconnect
 *     - Listening for new edges as a hint to reconnect if not already connected
 *     - The wrapper channel maintains a edge counter which is used as the channel version
 *
 * If needed we can also implement further functionality (like heartbeat) in this wrapper channel.
